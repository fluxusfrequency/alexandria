Description:
    This generator will create a repository for an ActiveRecord model. The newly
    created repository is an object of its own. You can then call AR methods on
    UserRepository. For example: UserRepository.find(2) or UserRepository.all.
    The User model will no longer support ActiveRecord methods, keeping it clean
    so that it only represents the business value of Users.

Example:
    rails generate repository User

    This will create a UserRepository model in /app/repositories.
